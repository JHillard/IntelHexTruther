# IntelHexTruther
Converts a logic state, or a truth table, into programmable Intel Hex code to write to a ROM of your choice.


TO USE:

a.) Run the script directly.
      For those who have a python environment already setup, execute the script HexReader1.py and follow its instructions.
      
b.) Run Executable.
      HexReader also comes as an executable. Navigate to dist/HexReader1 and open HexReader1.exe
      This is your choice if you haven't used python before. Be sure to copy the truth table you want to dist/HexReader1/ as well!
